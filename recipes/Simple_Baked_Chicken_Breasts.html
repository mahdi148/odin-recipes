            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
        </ol>
